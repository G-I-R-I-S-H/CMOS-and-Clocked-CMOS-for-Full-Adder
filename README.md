# CMOS-and-Clocked-CMOS-for-Full-Adder
Design and analysis of CMOS and Clocked CMOS logic for implementing a full adder. Includes transistor-level design, simulation, and performance comparison to evaluate power, delay, and area efficiency for digital circuit applications.
--
A **Full Adder** is a fundamental digital circuit that performs binary addition of three input bits — two significant bits (*A* and *B*) and a carry-in (*Cin*) — producing a **Sum** and a **Carry** output.

This project implements the Full Adder using two approaches:

- **Fully CMOS Logic Network** – Implements the logic using static CMOS design for stable performance.  
- **Clocked CMOS Logic Network** – Utilizes clocked transistors to optimize performance for specific applications.  

## Features
- Design and simulation of the **circuit diagram** and **truth table**.  
- **Performance analysis** of power consumption and propagation delay.  
- Validation of the design with simulation outputs.
